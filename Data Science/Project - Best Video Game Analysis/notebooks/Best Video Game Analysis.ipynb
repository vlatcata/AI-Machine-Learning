    "### Introduction: In this project, we will be trying to determine which is the best video game ever. (Released on steam)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to determine which is the best video game released on Steam. Since it would be impossible to analyze every game ever created, we will focus on Steam, one of the largest digital platforms for PC games. The dataset we are using contains games going back to 1997 and includes around 200,000 entries — a sufficiently large sample for meaningful analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to rank these games based on statistics, taking into account factors like playtime, reviews, achievements, and ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preperation: \n",
    "So, I was initially going to use 2-3 datasets and merge them, but after doing some research I realized that there almost no - good, up to date, clean, meaningful datasets about video games.\n",
    "I found one which is not bad but it's still filled with issues and missing information. Before I start modeling it I will try to create my own dataset using the Steam API and Steam Spy API to extract all available information about all videogames and then merging them, this process takes a long time so I will let the script run for a night, if it fails because of rate limits, memory limitation or some other issue I will go back to the Kaggle dataset and start preparing it. If it does work tho, I will simply continue work on my own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steam API has the official MetaData (release data, price, developers)\n",
    "- Steam Spy has estimated/publically scraped data (owners, playtime, achivements)"
