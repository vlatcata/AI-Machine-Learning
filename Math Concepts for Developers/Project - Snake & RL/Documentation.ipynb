    "# Snake game with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### This project is about making a snake game and using Reinforcement Learning to train a model to play\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the random people who find this in github, the best practice to run it is to create a venv and install all packages from the requirements.txt.**\n",
    "To do that, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m venv gameenv\n",
    "gameenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So... In order to make an AI model to play the game, first we need to code up the actual game.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the game, the libraries we will need are:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pygame\n",
    "import random\n",
    "from enum import Enum\n",
    "from collections import namedtuple\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The render font that I chose for the UI is arial.ttf, so we need to download that into the game folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the game we have the font, an enum class for Directions, a namedtuple we will be using to define each point in the game window, some color constants, block size we will be using for the objects in the game (snake body and food) and speed - which is the framerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpers we have for the game:**\n",
    "1. `arial.ttf` – font for game text\n",
    "2. `Direction` (Enum) – movement directions\n",
    "3. `Point` – named tuple for clean point management\n",
    "4. Color constants – `WHITE`, `RED`, etc. for `pygame`\n",
    "5. `BLOCK_SIZE` – the size of a single block (snake body / food)\n",
    "6. `SPEED` – frames per second (FPS) of the game\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game methods:**\n",
    "1. `__init__` - the constructor, in which we specialize the display width and height\n",
    "2. `_place_food()` - we place the food on a random place.\n",
    "3. `play_step()` - we change the snake's direction based on user input\n",
    "4. `_is_collision()` - we check if the snake bumped into something\n",
    "5. `_move()` - we apply the user input direction\n",
    "6. `_update_ui()` - we display and update the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the game works\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we start by placing the snake horizontally and placing the food on a random place. The snake's head is at the center of the screen with it's body going to the left by the _x_ axis, and the default starting movement being right _relative to the screen_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we start moving. The way we simulate movement is simple. We don't move each part of the snake each frame, instead, every step, we place a new head in the direction that the player specified and remove the tail if there was not food at that place. If there is food there, we don't remov the head and continue the loop. When we repeat that process really fast it looks like the whole snake is moving, but instead... we simply add a head and cut the tail really fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note - movement:** Game libraries don't use a normal coordinate system like in math. In games, in order to simulate monitor pixels, _x_ grows to the right, but _y_ grows downwards, not upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step/frame we check if there is a collision and stop the game if there is.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course we update the UI each frame too."

    "### Next Steps: Hooking up an AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the game mechanics are coded, the next step is to build an agent that plays the game using **Reubfircement Learning (RL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for that to happen, first we need to extend the `play_step()` and `move()` methods, and then we need to remove the `__name__ == __main__` check at the end as we won't be starting up the game directly anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying the `play_step()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the **Reinforcement Learning** magic happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is simple at its core. During training, we define rewards and penalties. The model is rewarded for good actions and penalized for bad ones. It learns through feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "``I ran into a wall and got a -10 reward --- I shouldn't do that.``\n",
    "\n",
    "``I ate the food and got +10 --- eating food is good!``\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the agent will now decide the snake’s direction, we add a second parameter to ``play_step()``: an ``action``, represented as a vector of type ``[float, float, float]`` (more on that later). This replaces keyboard input — we no longer listen to ``KEYDOWN`` events from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now... back to the sauce. We calculate the reward based on a couple of things. The main ones are obviously food and death. We reward the model 10 points for eating foor and -10 for dying.\n",
    "But as you can guess, since the display width is 640p, height is 480p and block size is 20x20, that means the probability of the snake getting the food is: $$\\frac{640}{20} \\times \\frac{480}{20} = 32 \\times 24 = 768 \\text{ total cells}$$ Meaning each move our change of getting food is: $$ \\frac{1}{768} \\approx 0.0013 \\text{ or } 0.13\\% $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what do we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Well... we simply need to calculate the reward better and more precisely. We introduce _immediate rewards_:**\n",
    "1. Since the agent will now decide the snake’s direction, we add a second parameter to play_step(): an action, represented as a vector of type [float, float, float] (more on that later). This replaces keyboard input — we no longer listen to KEYDOWN events from the user.\n",
    "    1. If the new distance is shorter, we give **+1 reward**.\n",
    "    2. If it’s **greater**, we apply a **−0.5** penalty.\n",
    "2. We check for body parts in 8 surrounding directions (excluding the neck).\n",
    "    1. For each nearby segment, we apply **−0.1**.\n",
    "    2. This encourages the snake to avoid trapping itself.\n",
    "3. If the snake loops around for too long, we penalize it using:\n",
    "    $$ Penalty = 100 * len(snake) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying the `_move()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Movement logic also needs to change. Instead of using fixed directions like UP or LEFT, we now handle **relative directions** based on the snake’s current heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the directions as a clock:\n",
    "`[RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, UP]`\n",
    "\n",
    "If a snake is heading right:\n",
    "  1. A **right** turn = DOWN\n",
    "  2. A **left** turn = UP\n",
    "  3. **Straight** = continue RIGHT\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model doesn’t choose absolute directions, it outputs a 3-element array:\n",
    " 1. `[1, 0, 0]` = go straight\n",
    " 2. `[0, 1, 0]` = go right\n",
    " 3. `[0, 0, 1]` = go left\n",
    "\n",
    " We translate it into a new direction like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]] = [straight, right, left]\n",
    "\n",
    "        clock_wise = [Direction.RIGHT, Direction.DOWN, Direction.LEFT, Direction.UP]\n",
    "        index = clock_wise.index(self.direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "        if np.array_equal(action, [1, 0, 0]):\n",
    "            new_direction = clock_wise[index] # straight - no change\n",
    "        elif np.array_equal(action, [0, 1, 0]):\n",
    "            next_index = (index + 1) % 4\n",
    "            new_direction = clock_wise[next_index] # turn right\n",
    "        else: # [0, 0, 1] = left\n",
    "            next_index = (index - 1) % 4\n",
    "            new_direction = clock_wise[next_index] # turn left\n",
    "\n",
    "        self.direction = new_direction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic ensures that the snake moves relative to its current direction — just like how a real animal (or robot) might navigate.\n"
